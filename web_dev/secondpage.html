        <h1>Fantastic Course!</h1>  
        <p>So far the experience has been thrilling, yet difficult at the same time. There are many rules to follow and if there is one thing I have learned, it is to be precise when you are typing your codes for the websites. If there is even a single mistake (punctuation, grammar, etc.), than it will result in an error on the web page.
    <h1>Learn to be Uncomfortable</h1>    
    <p> No matter what one's profession is, learning to program is vital because understanding the nature of technology can be powerful to one's mind. In the beginning of the class, I was a little bit skeptical about the class because I didn't have a lot of technology background. However, the more I embrace being uncomfortable, the more comfortable this is getting thanks to not only the help from the instructore, but also because through repetition.</p>

    <h1>Don't have to be a guru </h1>
        <p>As humans, we don't like disorder or unusual events. However, in order to conquer our fears, we must face them first. I have never a been a technology geek but this class has taught me that you don't have to be in order to learn about how powerful technologies are.</p>
    <h1>Embracing Vulnerability</h1>
    <h2>Success isn't easy and that's ok</h2>

        <h2>We all make mistakes. Learn from it!</h2>
        </section>
    <h3>Miscellaneous but important!</h3>
        <p>I am going to write a blog here on some of the few ways to become successful in a class such as this. One is to simply program and do the action instead of just watching the lectures and taking notes. Next, time management is extremely important! Last but not least, ask questions because that is the only way you'll learn from your mistakes.</p>
    <aside>Lesson from Albert Einstein</aside>
        <p>We have all heard of Albert Einstein before. Whether it's seeing the great scientist smoking his pipe, sticking out his tongue, or his strands of messy thick hair, Einstein shook the foundations of modern physics merely by thought experiments. He was a curious man who would always askquestions and if he didn't know somehting, he would rely on his friends. So take solace in knowing that even the great genius needed a little bit of assistance from his peers in order to change the world.</p>
